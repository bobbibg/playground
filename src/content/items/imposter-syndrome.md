I've been a making websites for over 10 years now. In that time I've often thought about starting a blog about my experiences as a developer, but never really got around to it before. Finally, I thought I'd give it a go!

## So why now?
Overall, I think I'm pretty good at my job. Or at least I hope I am! I'm up to speed on much of the latest goings on in the Javscript world (although, nowhere near everything, who on earth is!). I have worked with some big companies on some ambitious projects. I write Javascript in [ES6](http://es6-features.org/), have built production [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) / [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/) applications, and managed to get my head around [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). I even recently architected a bespoke front-end framework for a major global publisher.

Yet... despite, on the surface, having built up a nice career in the world of web development - I, like many people in the industry, suffer from pretty major [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). No matter, how much I learn, how much experience I get and how many times I prove myself to my peers, I always end up feeling like I'm some sort of fraud who is somehow stealing a living from all the smart people who really know what they are doing.

This is especially prevalent in the Javacript world, where the landscape is changing all the time and there is always something new to learn, that it's almost impossible to ever feel like an "expert".

## Why will writing help?
A few years back, I got my first job as a "lead" developer. This meant that, for the first time, my job wasn't just about writing code. Amongst the additional responsibilities were code review, setting standards and making tech decisions, but I was also required to act as a mentor to some young developers just starting out in their professional career.

I found mentoring a fulfilling experience for many reasons, but the relevant one in this case was the selfish reason - in helping others to learn, I found myself learning at a much faster rate too! I had to figure out how to break down the problems we were facing into smaller, more understandable chunks and to do that, I needed to understand, more than ever, exactly how specific APIs or libraries were working, not just what they did and how to use them. I became a better developer for it, and finally, started to feel a little less like a fraud.

Later this year my wife and I are expecting our first child. In preparation for this, I made a decision to move my career in a different direction. I've moved away from a permanent role in corporate development team, and instead am focusing on forging a freelance and consulting career that I hope will give me a lot more flexibility to spend time at home with my new family.

This blog is intended to help me continue in the habit of breaking down problems in such a way that they can be explained. And to give me a reason to keep diving deeper into the world of development and gain that deeper understanding. I'm not expecting many readers, I don't exactly intend on advertising it much, but if someone else finds it useful too, then that's a great bonus!

Now I just need to figure out what I want to write about!
