I've been a making websites for over 10 years now. In that time I've often thought about starting a blog about my experiences, but never really got around to it.

## So why now?
I think I'm pretty good at my job, or at least I hope I am! I'm up to speed on much of the latest goings on in the Javscript world (although, nowhere near everything, who on earth is!). I have worked with some big companies on some ambitious projects. I write Javascript in ES6, have worked on production React applications and managed to get my head around Webpack. I even recently architected a bespoke front-end framework for a major content publisher.

Yet... despite, on the surface, having a nice career in the world of web development - I, like many people in the industry, suffer from pretty major Imposter Syndrome.

This is especially prevalent in the Javacript world, where there is soooo much to know and things are moving so fast, that it's almost impossible to ever feel like an "expert".

## Why will writing help?
A couple of years ago, I got my first job as a "lead" developer. This meant that, for the first time, my job wasn't just about writing code. Amongst the additional responsibilities were code review, setting standards and making tech decisions, but I was also asked to help mentor some young developers starting out in their professional career for the first time.
