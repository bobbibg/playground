I've been a making websites for over 10 years now. In that time I've often thought about starting a blog about my experiences, but never really got around to it.

## So why now?
Overall, I think I'm pretty good at my job. Or at least I hope I am! I'm up to speed on much of the latest goings on in the Javscript world (although, nowhere near everything, who on earth is!). I have worked with some big companies on some ambitious projects. I write Javascript in ES6, have worked on production React/Redux applications, and managed to get my head around Webpack. I even recently architected a bespoke front-end framework for a major global publisher.

Yet... despite, on the surface, having built up a nice career in the world of web development - I, like many people in the industry, suffer from pretty major Imposter Syndrome. No matter, how much I learn, how much experience I get and how many times I prove myself at my job, I always end up feeling like I'm some sort of fraud who is somehow stealing a living from all the smart people who really know what they are doing.

This is especially prevalent in the Javacript world, where there is soooo much to know and things are moving so fast, that it's almost impossible to ever feel like an "expert".

## Why will writing help?
A couple of years ago, I got my first job as a "lead" developer. This meant that, for the first time, my job wasn't just about writing code. Amongst the additional responsibilities were code review, setting standards and making tech decisions, but I was also asked to help mentor some young developers starting out in their professional career for the first time.

I found mentoring a fulfilling experience for many reasons, but the relevant one for this point is the selfish one. In helping others to learn, I found myself learning at a much faster rate too! I had to figure out how to break down the problems we were facing into smaller, more understandable chunks and to do that, I needed to understand, more than ever, exactly how specific APIs or libraries were working, not just that they did and how to use them. I became a better developer for it, and finally, started to feel a little less like a fraud.

Later this year, my wife and I are expecting our first child. In preparation for this, I made a decision to move my career in a different direction. I've moved away from permanent corporate development teams, and am instead focusing on a freelance and consulting career that I hope will give me a lot more flexibility to spend time at home with my new family.

This blog is intended to help me continue in the habit of breaking down those problems in such a way that they can be explained. And to give me an reason to keep diving deeper into the world of development and gain that deeper understanding. If anyone else finds it useful too, then that's a great bonus!
