Fans of V-Moda's popular Crossfade M-80 on-ear headphones ($230) may not immediately notice that the V-Moda Crossfade M-100 ($310) is actually larger than its over-the-ear cousin, or that its hinged headband allows it to collapse into a small bundle. The M-100 has an engaging, lively sound that lets you hear lots of detail, but never sounds harsh or too bright.

##Design & Features
The V-Moda M-100 over-ear <a href="#">headphone is a close relative</a> to the company's popular M-80 on-ear headphone, with a few notable differences. Its CliqFold metal hinges -- a feature the M-80 lacks -- allows the M-100s to fold into a small bundle, and that adds value for traveling audiophiles. The M-100's ear cups' metal shields are user-replaceable and can be customized with a laser engraving of your own logo or artwork by V-Moda. Despite the obvious size differences, the M-100s are relatively light, weighing in at just 280 grams.

All V-Moda headphones are exceedingly rugged and overbuilt, and the M-100 is no exception. Designed to survive 70-plus impacts from a height of six feet onto a concrete floor, the steel-reinforced headband can be flattened 10 times and still return to its original curve. The faux-leather-covered, memory foam ear cushions are all user-replaceable and provide a tight, noise-blocking seal.

##Performance
The M-100 fits the bill for a "crossover" headphone that appeals to audiophiles as well as V-Moda's core customers, who prize potent bass and dynamic impact. The headphones have a larger-than-average 50mm driver in each ear cup, so the M-100 's bass response is fuller and richer sounding than the M-80's, with improved punch and clarity to boot. The headphones also have superior dynamic impact that excels at all volume levels.

Comparing the M-100 with Sennheiser's newly released full-size headphone ($350), the M-100 again has the advantage with its warmer bass and midrange, but I should note that the Momentum's stereo imaging, midrange clarity, and treble detail outpaced the M-100's. The M-100's richer sonic flair will definitely click with some buyers, but the Momentum should have stronger appeal to audiophiles craving maximum resolution of fine detail.
